# LightingSaver
Tool for saving lighting layouts in Blender.

Lighting Saver is an experimental addon for simplifying blender scene lighting.

The goal of the project is to create a tool that allows the user to save a given lighting layout to a database of layouts stored locally on their machines and to enable the user to easily and quickly preview and recall previously saved lighting layouts.

Initially the addon will focus only on lamps and not deal with HDR lighting due to the addional complexity of dealing with locally stored HDR images.
